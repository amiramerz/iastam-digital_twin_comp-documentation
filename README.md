# IoT Digital Twin for Facilities Management

This project leverages IoT and digital twin technology to optimize infrastructure management. It integrates sensor data with Building Collaboration Format (BCF) for real-time monitoring and anomaly detection.

## Key Features:
- Real-time data collection from multiple sensors.
- AI-powered anomaly detection.
- Integration with Building Information Modeling (BIM) using BCF.
- Visualized data using Firebase and Google Analytics.

## Repository Structure:
- **docs/**: Contains detailed documentation for the project.
- **images/**: Diagrams and visuals related to the project.
- **ai_model/**: AI code for data analysis and anomaly detection.
- **esp32_code/**: Code for the ESP32 microcontrollers (rooms and gateway).
  
## How to Use:
1. Set up the hardware (ESP32 devices and sensors).
2. Upload the ESP32 code in `esp32_code/` to the respective devices.
3. Train and deploy the AI model in `ai_model/`.
4. Follow the instructions in the `docs/` folder for detailed setup and usage.
